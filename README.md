"ADAS: Real-Time Traffic Sign Recognition" is an advanced system that detects and classifies traffic signs using deep learning and computer vision. It enhances driver awareness by providing real-time alerts, improving road safety through accurate recognition of speed limits, warnings, and other critical signs.



## Overview
**ADAS: Real-Time Traffic Sign Recognition** is a deep learning–based project designed to detect and classify traffic signs in real time. It enhances driver assistance systems by recognizing various road signs—such as speed limits, warnings, and prohibitions—and providing immediate alerts to improve road safety and situational awareness.

This project was developed as part of a college group project, focusing on combining computer vision and machine learning for intelligent transportation systems.
